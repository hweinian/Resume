      <p class="intro">I am aspiring to be a full-time programmer. Since young, the internet and video games have always been part of my life.
I've always wondered as to how these games were made and was inspired by the creativity that these developers had when developing the game.
After going through the introductory module of C programming and Python in the Polytechnic, I've come to enjoy programming and started learning programming during my free time.</p>
